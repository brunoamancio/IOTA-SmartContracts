### Compile the smart contract

With VSCode open, in a terminal (In the menu : Terminal > New Terminal), compile the smart contract with:

### Smart contract in Rust
```
wasm-pack build smartcontract/rust/
```

The compiled .wasm file is saved in `smartcontract/rust/pkg`.

### Smart contract in GO

TBD
